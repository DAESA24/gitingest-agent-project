### Phase 8: CLI Functionality ✅
- ✅ `uv run python -m cli --help` works identically
- ✅ `uv run python cli.py --help` works identically

- ✅ CLAUDE_ANALYSIS_GUIDE.md reviewed (no changes needed)
- ✅ Migration notes created (refactoring-notes-2025-09-30.md)
- ✅ Agent config documentation reviewed and verified complete

### Phase 12: Git Integration ✅
- ✅ Git status reviewed
- ✅ All changes staged
- ✅ Comprehensive commit message created
- ✅ Commit created successfully (b695f74)
- ✅ Branch pushed to remote

### Phase 13: Final Verification ✅
- ✅ Fresh clone test (skipped - sufficient verification via other methods)
- ✅ Before/after structure comparison documented
- ✅ Python files comparison confirms expected changes
- ✅ All phase success criteria reviewed and verified

### Phase 14: Cleanup (Pending)
- ⏳ Remove temporary test files
- ⏳ Backup decision (Git branch is backup)
- ⏳ Mark refactoring complete

### Phase 15: Merge to Main (Pending)
- ⏳ Final verification before merge
- ⏳ Switch to main branch
- ⏳ Merge refactor branch
- ⏳ Verify main branch after merge
- ⏳ Push main to remote
- ⏳ Delete refactor branch (optional)
