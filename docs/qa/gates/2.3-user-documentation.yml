# Recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate: []  # No blocking issues
  future:
    - action: "When tool is published to PyPI, update installation section to show PyPI installation as primary method and GitHub installation as development option"
      refs: ["README.md:22-48"]
      rationale: "Current GitHub-only installation is accurate but developer-focused. Future users will expect simpler PyPI installation."
    - action: "Consider adding visual diagrams for Phase 1.0 vs Phase 1.5 folder structure detection logic"
      refs: ["README.md:255-342"]
      rationale: "Current text explanation is excellent, but a flowchart could further enhance understanding of detection logic"

# Review Notes
notes: |
  Comprehensive review of user-facing documentation for v1.1.0 release.

  Strengths:
  - User-first structure with developer docs at bottom
  - All 4 CLI commands thoroughly documented with examples
  - Phase 1.5 features clearly explained with folder structure diagrams
  - Excellent troubleshooting section (6 scenarios with detailed solutions)
  - 4 common use cases with complete workflow examples
  - CHANGELOG.md follows Keep a Changelog format perfectly
  - All examples verified to work correctly per handoff
  - Markdown linting issues resolved

  Observations:
  - Installation section shows developer-style setup (git clone, uv sync) because
    tool is currently GitHub-only. This is accurate but may evolve when PyPI
    distribution is available. Not a blocker - documentation accurately reflects
    current state with appropriate note about future PyPI availability.

  No refactoring performed (documentation only).
  No code changes required.

  GATE: PASS - Ready for Done
