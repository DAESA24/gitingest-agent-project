# Story 1.1: Project Setup & Configuration

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer setting up the GitIngest Agent project,
**I want** the project infrastructure configured with UV and Click dependencies,
**so that** I can begin implementing features with proper tooling in place.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. pyproject.toml created with correct project metadata (name, version, description)
2. Python version requirement set to >=3.12
3. Click dependency added (>=8.1.0)
4. Project entry point configured: `gitingest-agent = "cli:gitingest_agent"`
5. .python-version file created and matches pyproject.toml requirement
6. Project directory structure verified (no new directories needed yet)
7. Basic README.md created with project description

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Create pyproject.toml configuration** (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)
  - [x] Set project name = "gitingest-agent"
  - [x] Set version = "0.1.0"
  - [x] Set description = "Automated GitHub repository analysis using GitIngest"
  - [x] Set requires-python = ">=3.12"
  - [x] Add Click dependency: "click>=8.1.0"
  - [x] Configure entry point: `[project.scripts]` section
  - [x] Set build-system to hatchling
  - [x] Add dev dependencies: pytest, pytest-cov, pytest-mock

- [x] **Task 2: Create supporting configuration files** (AC: 5, 6)
  - [x] Create .python-version file with "3.12"
  - [x] Verify .python-version matches pyproject.toml requires-python
  - [x] Create .gitignore with Python/UV patterns (venv, __pycache__, *.pyc, .pytest_cache, etc.)
  - [x] Verify BMAD directories exist (.bmad-core/, docs/, docs/stories/)

- [x] **Task 3: Create basic README.md** (AC: 7)
  - [x] Add project title and description
  - [x] Add installation instructions (UV setup)
  - [x] Add basic usage placeholder
  - [x] Reference BMAD workflow

- [x] **Task 4: Verify UV environment**
  - [x] Run `uv sync` to create virtual environment
  - [x] Verify Click is installed
  - [x] Verify GitIngest CLI is available globally

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Overview
This story establishes the foundational project configuration. No feature code is implemented - only infrastructure setup. All subsequent stories depend on this configuration being in place.

[Source: prd.md#TR1 Technology Stack, architecture.md#9.2 Configuration]

### Project Configuration Details

**pyproject.toml Structure:**
```toml
[project]
name = "gitingest-agent"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Automated GitHub repository analysis using GitIngest"
requires-python = ">=3.12"
dependencies = [
    "click>=8.1.0",
]

[project.scripts]
gitingest-agent = "cli:gitingest_agent"

[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[tool.pytest.ini_options]
testpaths = ["tests"]
python_files = ["test_*.py"]
```
[Source: architecture.md#9.2]

**Why UV Package Manager:**
- 10-100x faster than pip
- Automatic virtual environment management
- Built-in project scaffolding
- Compatible with standard Python tooling
[Source: prd.md#TR1]

**Why Click Framework:**
- Command grouping (parent with subcommands)
- Argument and option parsing
- Built-in error handling
- Testing support via CliRunner
[Source: prd.md#TR1]

### Project Structure (Verification Only)

Expected structure after this story:
```
gitingest-agent-project/
├── .bmad-core/           # Already exists
├── .venv/                # Created by uv sync
├── .gitignore            # Created in this story
├── .python-version       # Created in this story
├── docs/                 # Already exists
│   ├── prd.md
│   ├── architecture.md
│   └── stories/          # Already exists
├── pyproject.toml        # Created in this story
├── README.md             # Created in this story
└── (modules created in later stories)
```
[Source: architecture.md#TR3]

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT create module files (cli.py, token_counter.py, etc.) in this story. Those are created in their respective stories.

### Technical Constraints

- Python version: >=3.12 [Source: prd.md#TR1]
- Click version: >=8.1.0 [Source: prd.md#TR1]
- GitIngest: Already installed globally via `uv tool install gitingest` (external dependency)
- No config files needed beyond pyproject.toml
- No environment variables required
[Source: architecture.md#9.2]

### .gitignore Patterns

Essential Python/UV patterns to include:
```
# Python
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class
*.so
.Python

# Virtual Environment
.venv/
venv/
ENV/

# Testing
.pytest_cache/
.coverage
htmlcov/
*.cover

# UV
uv.lock

# IDE
.vscode/
.idea/

# Project specific
data/
analyze/
.ai/
```

### Success Criteria

**Functional Completeness:**
- [x] `uv sync` completes successfully
- [x] Virtual environment created in .venv/
- [x] Click package available in environment
- [x] README.md provides basic project information

**No Feature Code:**
- [x] No .py module files created (those come in later stories) - *Note: Empty placeholder files created, acceptable deviation*
- [x] Only configuration and documentation files

## Testing

### Testing Standards

**No unit tests required for this story** - This is pure configuration/infrastructure setup.

**Validation Steps:**
1. Run `uv sync` and verify no errors
2. Activate virtual environment and verify Click is importable: `python -c "import click; print(click.__version__)"`
3. Verify GitIngest CLI is available: `gitingest --version`
4. Verify file structure matches expected layout

**Manual Verification Checklist:**
- [x] pyproject.toml is valid TOML syntax
- [x] Python version constraint is correct
- [x] Entry point references cli:gitingest_agent (will be created in Story 1.8)
- [x] README.md is readable and informative

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Manual setup by developer (pre-story execution)

### Debug Log References
N/A - Manual configuration

### Completion Notes

**Implementation Status:** Story completed manually during initial project setup phase.

**Work Completed:**
1. ✅ pyproject.toml created with all required configuration
2. ✅ .python-version created and verified to match pyproject.toml (3.12)
3. ✅ .gitignore created with comprehensive Python/UV patterns
4. ✅ README.md created with project documentation
5. ✅ UV environment initialized (.venv/)
6. ✅ Click dependency installed (8.3.0)
7. ✅ GitIngest CLI verified available globally
8. ✅ BMAD directories verified present

**Enhanced Beyond Story Requirements:**
- Added `[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]` configuration for package building
- Added comprehensive `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` with coverage settings
- Created both `[project.optional-dependencies]` and `[dependency-groups]` for dev dependencies
- README.md includes phase tracking, technology stack, and comprehensive setup instructions

**Acceptable Deviations:**
- Empty module files created prematurely (cli.py, token_counter.py, workflow.py, storage.py, extractor.py)
  - **Rationale:** Files contain only docstrings, no implementation
  - **Impact:** Minimal - violates story boundary but doesn't affect functionality
  - **Decision:** Acceptable for workflow efficiency; implementations will follow respective stories
  - **Note:** main.py also created (not in any story) - can be removed if needed

**Version Mismatch Corrected:**
- Fixed .python-version from "3.13" to "3.12" to match pyproject.toml requirement (AC #5)

**All Acceptance Criteria Met:** ✅

### File List
- pyproject.toml (created)
- .python-version (created, corrected to 3.12)
- .gitignore (created)
- README.md (created)
- .venv/ (directory created by UV)
- uv.lock (generated by UV)
- tests/__init__.py (created)

**Prematurely Created (acceptable deviation):**
- cli.py (empty, docstring only)
- token_counter.py (empty, docstring only)
- workflow.py (empty, docstring only)
- storage.py (empty, docstring only)
- extractor.py (empty, docstring only)
- main.py (not in stories, can be removed)
