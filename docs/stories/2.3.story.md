  - [ ] Ensure proper Keep a Changelog format maintained

## Dev Notes

### Context

This story creates user-facing documentation for the v1.1.0 release, which includes:
- Phase 1.5 universal convention (context/related-repos/)
- CLI parameter support (--output-dir)
- Bug fixes from Stories 2.1 and 2.2

The documentation should help **new users** get started quickly, not just developers contributing to the project.

### Documentation Structure

**Current README.md:** Developer-focused (project structure, dev setup, testing)

**Target README.md:** Balanced user + developer documentation
1. User-facing content first (installation, usage, examples)
2. Developer content second (contributing, architecture, testing)

### Key Features to Document

**Phase 1.5 Features (NEW in v1.1.0):**
- Automatic context/related-repos/ creation in any directory
- Smart detection: gitingest-agent-project vs other projects
- No project pollution (no random data/ folders)
- Universal convention documented

**CLI Parameters (NEW in v1.1.0):**
- --output-dir on all commands
- Path validation and prompts
- Relative and absolute path support

**Core Features (Phase 1.0):**
- Token size checking (200k threshold)
- Full extraction for small repos
- Tree + selective extraction for large repos
- Analysis generation (installation/workflow/architecture)

### Example Command Outputs

Include real output examples to set expectations:

```bash
$ gitingest-agent check-size https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World

Token count: 47 tokens
Route: full extraction
```

```bash
$ gitingest-agent extract-full https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World

Extracting full repository...
[OK] Saved to: /home/user/my-project/context/related-repos/Hello-World/digest.txt
Token count: 47 tokens
```

### Tone and Style

- **Clear and concise** - Users want to get started quickly
- **Example-driven** - Show don't tell
- **Friendly but professional** - CLI tool for developers
- **Accurate** - All examples must work

### Non-Goals

- Do NOT create separate user guide files (keep everything in README.md)
- Do NOT document internal implementation details
- Do NOT explain BMAD methodology in user docs
- Do NOT include Claude Code workflow automation details

### Testing Documentation

Before completion:
1. Run every command example in the documentation
2. Verify all paths and outputs are correct
3. Check for typos and broken links
4. Ensure markdown renders correctly

### Files to Update

**Modified:**
- README.md - Complete rewrite of user-facing sections

**No new files needed** - Everything goes in README.md
