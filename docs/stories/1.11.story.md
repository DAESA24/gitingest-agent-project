# Story 1.11: Token Overflow Prevention & Re-check

## Status
Complete

## Story
**As a** user who extracted selective content from a large repository,
**I want** the system to verify the extracted content is under 200k tokens,
**so that** I don't experience context overflow during analysis even after filtering.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. extract_specific command automatically re-checks token count after extraction
2. If token count still >= 200k, user is warned and prompted for action
3. User options displayed: 1) Narrow selection further, 2) Proceed with partial
4. Warning message shows current token count and target threshold
5. Iterative refinement loop allows multiple narrowing attempts
6. User can exit loop by selecting "Proceed with partial"
7. Unit tests verify re-check logic and user prompting

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Add size re-check to extract_specific command** (AC: 1, 2, 4)
  - [x] After extraction, count tokens using count_tokens_from_file()
  - [x] Check if token_count >= 200_000
  - [x] If overflow detected, display warning message
  - [x] Show current token count vs. target (200,000)
  - [x] Display overflow amount: token_count - 200_000

- [x] **Task 2: Implement user prompting for overflow** (AC: 3, 5, 6)
  - [x] Display options menu:
    - "1) Narrow selection further"
    - "2) Proceed with partial content"
  - [x] Use click.prompt() to get user choice
  - [x] If choice 1: Prompt for new content type, re-extract, re-check (loop)
  - [x] If choice 2: Display warning and proceed
  - [x] Validate user input (handle invalid choices)

- [x] **Task 3: Implement iterative refinement loop** (AC: 5)
  - [x] Create while loop: while token_count >= 200_000
  - [x] Display current extraction metadata (type, token count)
  - [x] Prompt for user decision
  - [x] If narrowing: Re-run extract_specific with new type
  - [x] Re-check token count after each extraction
  - [x] Exit loop when under threshold or user chooses to proceed

- [x] **Task 4: Write unit tests** (AC: 7)
  - [x] Test extract_specific with overflow detection
  - [x] Test overflow warning message display
  - [x] Test user prompt for narrowing vs. proceeding
  - [x] Test iterative refinement loop (multiple attempts)
  - [x] Test loop exit when under threshold
  - [x] Mock user input using CliRunner.invoke with input parameter
  - [x] Mock count_tokens_from_file() for controlled token counts

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Dependencies:
- Story 1.5 (token_counter) - count_tokens_from_file(), should_extract_full()
- Story 1.4 (workflow) - format_token_count()
- Story 1.10 (CLI) - extract_specific command

### Critical Issue from V2 Specification

**Problem Statement:**
> "After retrieving the tree and documentation, I need another check to ensure the combined content doesn't exceed the limit again. Currently, it can overshoot."

This is a **critical bug** identified in the original video implementation that must be addressed in Phase 1.

### Architecture Overview
This story enhances extract_specific with size verification and iterative refinement. It prevents the critical issue where selective extraction still exceeds token limits, causing context overflow during analysis.

### Enhanced extract_specific Implementation

```python
@gitingest_agent.command()
@click.argument('url')
@click.option('--type', 'content_type', required=True,
              type=click.Choice(['docs', 'installation', 'code', 'auto']),
              help='Type of content to extract')
def extract_specific(url: str, content_type: str):
    """Extract specific content with token overflow prevention."""
    try:
        repo_name = parse_repo_name(url)

        # Initial extraction
        click.echo(f"Extracting {content_type} content...")
        output_path = extractor.extract_specific(url, repo_name, content_type)

        # Token re-check loop
        while True:
            token_count = count_tokens_from_file(output_path)
            formatted = format_token_count(token_count)

            click.echo(f"✓ Saved to: {output_path}")
            click.echo(f"Token count: {formatted}")

            # Check for overflow
            if token_count < 200_000:
                # Success - under threshold
                break

            # Overflow detected
            overflow = token_count - 200_000
            click.echo(f"\n⚠️  Content exceeds token limit!")
            click.echo(f"   Current: {formatted}")
            click.echo(f"   Target: 200,000 tokens")
            click.echo(f"   Overflow: {overflow:,} tokens")
            click.echo("\nOptions:")
            click.echo("  1) Narrow selection further")
            click.echo("  2) Proceed with partial content")

                click.echo("   Analysis may be truncated")
                break
            elif choice == 1:
                # Re-extract with narrower selection
                click.echo("\nWhat would you like to extract instead?")
                click.echo("Suggestion: Try a more specific filter:")
                click.echo("  - installation: Just setup files")
                click.echo("  - auto: README + minimal docs")

                new_type = click.prompt(
                    "Content type",
                    type=click.Choice(['docs', 'installation', 'code', 'auto']),
                    default='installation'
                )

                # Re-extract
                click.echo(f"\nExtracting {new_type} content...")
                output_path = extractor.extract_specific(url, repo_name, new_type)
                content_type = new_type  # Update for next iteration
            else:
                click.echo("Invalid choice. Please select 1 or 2.")

    except GitIngestError as e:

### Expected Output Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Selective extraction still exceeds limit**
```
$ gitingest-agent extract-specific https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi --type docs

Extracting docs content...
✓ Saved to: /path/to/data/fastapi/docs-content.txt
Token count: 287,523 tokens

⚠️  Content exceeds token limit!
   Current: 287,523 tokens
   Target: 200,000 tokens
   Overflow: 87,523 tokens

Options:
  1) Narrow selection further
  2) Proceed with partial content

Select option [1]: 1

What would you like to extract instead?
Suggestion: Try a more specific filter:
  - installation: Just setup files
  - auto: README + minimal docs

Content type [installation]: installation

Extracting installation content...
✓ Saved to: /path/to/data/fastapi/installation-content.txt
Token count: 12,450 tokens
```

**Scenario 2: User proceeds despite overflow**
```
Options:
  1) Narrow selection further
  2) Proceed with partial content

Select option [1]: 2

⚠️  Warning: Proceeding with content exceeding token limit
   Analysis may be truncated
```

### Design Decisions

**Why while loop for re-check:**
- Allows multiple refinement attempts
- User may need 2-3 iterations to get under threshold
- Clear exit conditions: under threshold OR user chooses proceed
[Source: prd.md#FR5, architecture.md#5.2]

**Why display overflow amount:**
- User understands severity of overflow
- Helps guide narrowing decision (87k overflow = need much narrower filter)
- Clear numeric feedback
[Source: prd.md#US4]

**Why suggest alternative content types:**
- Guides user toward effective refinement
- "installation" typically smallest (setup files only)
- "auto" is conservative middle ground
- Prevents random guessing
[Source: prd.md#FR5]

**Why allow "Proceed with partial":**
- Escape hatch for edge cases
- User may accept truncation
- Better than forcing arbitrary limits
- Transparent about consequences
[Source: prd.md#FR5, architecture.md#11.1]

**Maximum refinement attempts:**
Phase 1 doesn't enforce hard limit. User can iterate until satisfied or choose to proceed. Future enhancement could add "give up after 3 attempts" logic.
[Source: prd.md#FR5]

**Iteration Limit Considerations:**

**Phase 1 Approach (No Hard Limit):**
- User maintains full control over refinement loop
- Can iterate indefinitely until finding acceptable extraction
- Exit via: under threshold OR explicit "proceed with partial" choice
- Risk: Infinite loop if user never chooses to proceed (mitigated by clear option 2)

**Advantages:**
- Maximum flexibility for edge cases
- No artificial constraints on user workflow
- Clear exit path always available (option 2)
- Matches iterative nature of exploration

**Future Enhancement (Phase 2+):**
- After 3 unsuccessful attempts, add option: "3) Extract tree only (no content)"
- After 5 attempts, auto-suggest giving up with helpful message
- Track attempt count and display progress indicator
- Example: "Attempt 3/5 - Consider narrowing further or proceeding"

**Why No Limit Now:**
- Keeps implementation simple for Phase 1
- User feedback needed to determine optimal limit
- Current design prevents true infinite loop (always option to proceed)
- YAGNI principle - add complexity when proven necessary

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4.5 (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)

### Debug Log References
No issues encountered - implementation went smoothly with comprehensive test coverage

### Completion Notes
**Critical Bug Fix:**
This story addresses the critical issue identified in the PRD (Section 7.1): "After retrieving the tree and documentation, I need another check to ensure the combined content doesn't exceed the limit again. Currently, it can overshoot."

**Implementation Summary:**
- Modified extract_specific command in cli.py to include token re-check loop
- Added overflow detection after extraction (threshold: 200k tokens)
- Implemented user prompting with two options: narrow selection or proceed with partial
- Created iterative refinement loop allowing multiple narrowing attempts
- User can exit loop by: content under threshold OR choosing "proceed with partial"
- Clear warning messages with overflow amount calculation
- Suggestions provided for narrower content type selections

**Test Results:**
- 7 new tests for token overflow prevention (100% pass rate)
- Combined with existing tests: 41 tests passing total
- cli.py coverage: 96% (113 statements, 5 misses on exception paths and __main__)
- Test coverage includes:
  - Under threshold (no prompt)
  - Overflow with user proceeding
  - Single narrowing iteration
  - Multiple narrowing iterations
  - Exact threshold boundary (199,999 vs 200,001)
  - Invalid user choice handling

**Key Features Implemented:**
1. **Token Re-check Loop:** After extraction, checks if content < 200k tokens
2. **Overflow Warning:** Displays current count, target, and overflow amount
3. **User Options:** 1) Narrow selection further, 2) Proceed with partial content
4. **Iterative Refinement:** Allows multiple attempts to narrow until under threshold
5. **Content Type Suggestions:** Guides user toward "installation" or "auto" for narrower extractions
6. **Transparent Exit:** User always has option to proceed despite overflow
7. **Invalid Choice Handling:** Re-prompts if user enters invalid option

**User Experience:**
- Clear visual indicators (⚠️  emoji for warnings)
- Formatted token counts with commas for readability
- Helpful suggestions for content type narrowing
- Default option (1 - narrow) for safety
- Exit warning when proceeding with overflow

### File List
**Modified:**
- cli.py: Enhanced extract_specific command with overflow prevention loop (lines 146-234, +60 lines)
- tests/test_cli.py: Added TestTokenOverflowPrevention class with 7 comprehensive tests (+164 lines)
