# GitIngest Agent

Automated GitHub repository analysis tool using GitIngest CLI and Claude Code.

## Status

**Phase:** 1 - Core Clone ✅ **COMPLETE**
- ✅ Explore Phase: Research complete
- ✅ Plan Phase: PRD & Architecture complete
- ✅ Story Creation: 13 stories generated by SM agent
- ✅ Project Setup: UV project initialized
- ✅ Execute Phase: All 13 stories implemented
- ✅ Testing: 190 tests passing, 96%+ coverage
- ✅ Documentation: Complete story records and workflow automation

## Overview

GitIngest Agent eliminates manual friction in analyzing GitHub repositories by:
- **Automatic token size checking** (200k threshold)
- **Intelligent workflow routing** (full vs selective extraction)
- **Claude Code integration** via CLAUDE.md automation
- **Structured analysis storage** for future reference

### Key Features (Phase 1)

1. **Token Size Checking** - Automatic repository token counting
2. **Full Extraction** - Complete repository content for repos < 200k tokens
3. **Selective Extraction** - Targeted content extraction for repos >= 200k tokens
4. **Size Re-Check** - Prevents token overflow after selective extraction
5. **Analysis Generation** - Installation, workflow, or architecture analysis
6. **Optional Storage** - Save analyses to analyze/ folder

## Technology Stack

- **Python 3.12+** - Core language
- **UV Package Manager** - Fast dependency management
- **Click Framework** - CLI interface
- **GitIngest CLI** - Repository extraction (external tool)
- **BMAD Methodology** - Development workflow

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- UV package manager installed
- GitIngest CLI installed globally (`uv tool install gitingest`)
- Git for version control

### Installation

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd "Software Projects/gitingest-agent-project"

# Sync environment (creates .venv and installs dependencies)
uv sync

# Install in development mode
uv pip install -e .

# Verify installation
uv run gitingest-agent --help
uv run pytest --version
```

## Development Workflow

This project follows the **BMAD (Breakthrough Method for AI-driven Agile Development)** methodology with integrated QA.

### Phase 1 Complete ✅

All 13 stories (1.2-1.14) implemented using BMAD workflow:

**Completed:**
1. ✅ Story Creation with Scrum Master agent (`@sm *draft`)
2. ✅ Story Implementation with Developer agent (`@dev *develop-story`)
3. ✅ Test-driven development (190 tests, 96%+ coverage)
4. ✅ Comprehensive documentation (story records, workflow automation)

### BMAD Workflow Reference

- **Story Creation**: `@sm *draft` ✅
- **Story Implementation**: `@dev *develop-story {story}` ✅
- **Story Review**: `@qa *review {story}` (Optional)
- **Risk Assessment**: `@qa *risk {story}` (Optional)
- **Test Design**: `@qa *design {story}` (Optional)

See `.bmad-core/enhanced-ide-development-workflow.md` for complete workflow details.

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest --cov

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_token_counter.py

# Run with verbose output
uv run pytest -v
```

## CLI Usage

The CLI is fully implemented and ready to use:

```bash
# Check repository token size
uv run gitingest-agent check-size https://github.com/user/repo

# Extract full repository (< 200k tokens)
uv run gitingest-agent extract-full https://github.com/user/repo

# Extract tree structure (>= 200k tokens)
uv run gitingest-agent extract-tree https://github.com/user/repo

# Extract specific content with overflow prevention
uv run gitingest-agent extract-specific https://github.com/user/repo --type docs
uv run gitingest-agent extract-specific https://github.com/user/repo --type installation
uv run gitingest-agent extract-specific https://github.com/user/repo --type code
uv run gitingest-agent extract-specific https://github.com/user/repo --type auto
```

### Automated Workflow

For Claude Code users, simply provide a GitHub URL in your conversation:

```
Analyze https://github.com/user/repo
```

Claude Code will automatically:
1. Check token size
2. Route to appropriate extraction workflow
3. Prompt for analysis type (installation/workflow/architecture/custom)
4. Generate detailed analysis
5. Optionally save to `analyze/` folder

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for complete workflow automation details.
